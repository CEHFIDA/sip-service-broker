    <para>Applications servers might initiate dialogs excluded from orchestration chain.
        Such additional dialogs are created with INVITE requests with special header
        <emphasis role="bold">x-ica: true</emphasis> or <emphasis role="bold">x-mrf: true</emphasis>.
        These dialogs create so called auxiliary session, where broker acts as B2BUA simply forwarding all requests
        and responses between originating application server and IM-SCF.
        From the broker point of view there is no relation between the orchestrated session and these special dialogs.
        Therefore auxiliary session initialization and termination is done independently from the orchestrated session,
        i.e. the session control is fully managed by the originating application server.

    <para>Reliable responses sent with special header <emphasis role="bold">x-as: true</emphasis> are considered
        as responses originated from application servers. Such responses are forwarded back only to the last application server
        that originated its own reliable response or to the IM-SCF (if none of the application servers originated reliable response).
        This special chaining also involves PRACK with its 200 OK response.
    </para>
    <para>
        The treatment above does not apply to regular reliable responses, i.e. the ones originating from IM-SCF B leg.
        These responses (and corresponding PRACK/200OK) are forwarded back through all the application servers in the chain.
